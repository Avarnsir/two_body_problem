#Two Body Problem

##Description
The two-body problem is a classic problem in astrophysics where we simulate the motion of two celestial bodies (eg: stars, planets)

*Code Overview*
The simulation is implemented in Python. Key steps include:
1. Defining constants and initial conditions.
2. Updating positions and velocities using the Euler method.
3. Visualizing the orbits using Matplotlib.

*Run the code*
